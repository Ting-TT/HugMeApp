Made by Me & my three other teammates: Qianxuan Lin, Xie Hu, Xitong Liu  
for COMP2100-6442 Assignment 1.

## Idea
An app to help/save/report injured animals(pets/wildlife)

<br/>

## Data Imported
1. Animal vet address/ phone number:
    to save injured animals/wildlife.

2. Related department address/ phone number:
    - to report animal abuse/ neglect.
    - to report circumstances of maintaining illegal wildlife (e.g., endangered).

3. Initial user information (Vets)

<br/>

## Summary
The app aims to help/save/report injured animals(pets/wildlife) and are divided to two parts. Any posts can be reshared within the app.

### Part 1. Rescuing an injured animal
When users find an injured animal, they can log in to the app. Based on their current locations, nearby vets are recommended to them. Users can choose to call the vet for help. If it is a protected animal or illegally kept animal, users can choose to call local department listed in the app as well.

### Part 2. Community to protect animals
Vets post pictures of animals in the app as the administrators. Users can ‘like’ and comments under posts. Comments left under posts (or direct message the vets) help users to adopt pets.
Users can search the type of pets they want to adopt and browse posts of the specific type of pets.

2. Search for information (vets, departments, posts, users)

### Additional:
1.	Improved Search: Handle partially valid and invalid search queries. (Medium)
2.	UI Design and Testing: UI has portrait and landscape layout variants as well as support for different screen size. (Easy)
3.	Greater Data Usage, Handling and Sophistication:
    - Read data instances from multiple files in different formats (JSON, XML, etc.). (Easy)
    - User profile containing image (as well as username, user id, gender(optional), location(optional)). (Easy)
    - GPS (Easy)
    - Deletion method of tree data structure. (Hard)
4.	User Interactivity:
    - The ability to ‘like’ a post. (Easy)
    - The ability to ‘follow’ users. (Medium)
5.	Peer to Peer Messaging: Provide users with the ability to message each other or an institution directly (Hard) – MAYBE
